This project report is submitted as part of the Modeling and Simulation Course. The main intension of the project was to implement a simple 433Mhz module on Digilent Nexys2 development board. This is used to transfer data wirelessly from FPGA board to Arduino Uno using the RF module and displaying the data on 16x2 LCD.
